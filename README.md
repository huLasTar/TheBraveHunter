# The Brave Hunter

### A similar game to Duck Hunt by László Tarnai

A simple point-n-click first person shooter game.

## Requirements

An up-to-date web browser and a mouse.

## Gameplay

The player is required to successfully shoot all of the birds appearing on the screen until 500 kills. The difficulty increases as the player kills the birds; the number of targets will be raised after every 50 new kills. In the beginning the player gets 20 bullets as ammo. Missed shots decreases the level of ammo; the player cannot shoot on the birds, if the remaining ammo is zero. If a bird flies out from the screen on the left, it will result directly in a game over.
